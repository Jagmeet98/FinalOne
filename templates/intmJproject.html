    <h4>1. Data Visualization Software</h4>
      <p>The presentation creation and visual representation of data in the graphical or pictorial format are referred to as Data Visualization. Data Visualization has become an active field of research & development by being closely related to information graphics and visualization, statistical graphics and scientific visualization.

        The project displays the node connectivity in networking in data visualization form. This node connectivity can be located at different locations via mouse or trackpad. The project has the following goals & objectives:

        Effective and Clear Communication of information using graphical & pictorial means.
        It should have both functionality and Aesthetic.
        It should convey ideas effectively & provide necessary insights into complex sets of data & information.
        Data Visualization software makes it easier for the user to understand & grasp the information when they are displayed or represented as charts or graphs rather than report pages.</p>

        <h4>2. ATM Interface</h4>
          <p>We have all come across ATMs in our cities and it is built on Java. This complex project consists of five different classes and is a console-based application. When the system starts the user is prompted with user id and user pin. On entering the details successfully, then ATM functionalities are unlocked. The project allows to perform following operations:
            <ol>
              <li>Transactions History</li>
              <li>Withdraw</li>
              <li>Deposit</li>
              <li> Transfer</li>
              <li>Quit</li>
          </ol>

            <h4>3. Airline Reservation System</h4>
              <p>The project is web-based featuring open architecture that means the app keeps up with the dynamic needs of the airline business by addition of new systems & functionality. The project includes online transaction, fares, inventory & e-ticket operations.

                The software consists of four key modules i.e. user registration, login, reservation and cancellation. The app allows communication through a TCP/IP network protocol thereby facilitating the usage of internet & intranet communication globally.
                <ol>
                The main features of the project are:

                <li>Reservation & cancellation of the tickets.</li>
                <li>Automation of system functions.</li>
                <li>Quick customer responses.</li>
                <li>Perform transaction management & routing functions.</li>
                <li> Maintain passenger records.</li>
              </ol></p>
