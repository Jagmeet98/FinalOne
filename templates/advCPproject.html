    <h4>1. Car Rental System</h4>
      <p>This is a trendy project and very useful for learning about keyboard events, date-time functions, and implementing a C++ login system. The program has separate menus for admin and other users. There are also methods to calculate fare based on time and distance, including displaying car details, availability, etc.</p>

        <h4>2. Credit Card Validator</h4>
          <p>This is a simple project that uses Luhn’s algorithm to validate a user's credit card. The program works for all popular cards like Visa, Amex, MasterCard, etc. Luhn’s algorithm checks for basic validations; for example, a Visa card should start with 4 and then moves on to complex digit-wise calculations. It is a good program to learn because most e-commerce transactions require credit card validation.
